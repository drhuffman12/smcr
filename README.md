# smcr

State Machine for Crystal

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     smcr:
       github: drhuffman12/smcr
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

For the states, we use Enums, which are importable from JSON.
You might think that we should use Symbols, but those are NOT JSON import-able!
See: https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/how-to-do-from-json-with-symbol-variables/3379/2 .

```crystal
require "smcr"
```

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

To enable debug comment logging, set `CRYSTAL_DEBUG` env variable to anything other than an empty string. For example:

```
# debug logging enabled
CRYSTAL_DEBUG=soME_nOn_Blank_VALue crystal spec

# debug logging disabled
CRYSTAL_DEBUG= crystal spec
```

This will show at least:
```
Smcr::VERSION # => "0.1.0"
```

Use this to output additional debug info like:
```
p! Smcr::VERSION if Smcr::DEBUG_ENABLED
```
